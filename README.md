HTML project with CSS. It is going to be a website that contains basic cooking recipes.

Skills to be learned:
1. HTML basics. Working with default html boilerplate, using different elements, tags, apply the importance of accessibility, etc. 

Reflection:
I can see how fundamental HTML is to creating a webpage. I can't deny that creating these very simple webpages has been a lot of fun. I cannot wait to learn CSS and JS to add styling and behaviours respectively. The adventure cannot wait long enough! 


## Update February 12th 2022
Will be updating the site with basic CSS using the external method. Will be focusing mostly on basic css properties as a practice but will have the goal of making the site still readable (hopefully better) and aesthetically better!

Reflection:
Applying CSS elements improved the website tremendously. I believe it is aesthetically more pleasing, while also being more readable than it was before. I had searched a color palette that can help me choose the right colors (because I don't know enough color theory!), as well as how to style links because barebones links just looks very bare. So far, I can definitely see the importance and just how essential CSS is alongside HTML.
