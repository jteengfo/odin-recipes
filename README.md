Skills to be learned:
1. HTML basics. Working with default html boilerplate, using different elements, tags, apply the importance of accessibility, etc. 

Reflection:
I can see how fundamental HTML is to creating a webpage. I can't deny that creating these very simple webpages has been a lot of fun. I cannot wait to learn CSS and JS to add styling and behaviours respectively. The adventure cannot wait long enough!
