    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Pasta carbonara is one of those simple dinners we should all know how to make. 
            It's the perfect go-to for a busy weeknight, and it's also a dish fit for the weekend or even to serve to guests.</p>
        <p>If you've never had homemade pasta carbonara before, you're in for a real treat! 
            Pasta carbonara typically features a creamy sauce that's made with pancetta, garlic, heavy cream, cheese and eggs. 
            The egg-based sauce is cooked by combining it with the piping hot spaghetti pasta and a little of the cooking water.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>8 - 10 slices bacon , cut into 1/2-inch pieces</li>
                <li>8 1/2 cups water , divided</li>
                <li>4 cloves garlic , minced</li>
                <li>1 lb spaghetti or linguine</li>
                <li>1 1/4 cups finely grated parmesan cheese , plus more for serving (2 oz)</li>
                <li>3 large eggs</li>
                <li>1 large egg yolk</li>
                <li>1 tsp each salt and pepper , or to taste</li>
                <li>Chopped fresh parsley , for garnish</li>
            </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Add bacon and 1/2 cup of the water to a large non-stick skillet and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat.</li>
                <li>Allow to simmer until water evaporates about 6 - 7 minutes, then reduce heat to medium-low and continue to cook until 
                    bacon is brown and crisp, about 6 - 8 minutes longer. </li>
                <li>Place a fine mesh strainer over a bowl then pour bacon into strainer while reserving about 1 tsp of the rendered fat in pan. 
                    Return pan to heat and saute garlic about 30 seconds, until fragrant and lightly golden.</li>
                <li>Pour into a medium mixing bowl then add 1 Tbsp rendered bacon fat (drippings in bowl set under strainer) to mixing bowl with garlic. 
                    Add eggs, egg yolk, parmesan and pepper to garlic mixture and whisk until well combined.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, bring 8 cups of water to a boil in a large dutch oven (no more than 8 cups because you want a very starchy water for the sauce). 
                    Add spaghetti and salt to boiling water and cook until al dente. While pasta is boiling, set a colander in a large bowl.</li>
                <li>Carefully drain al dente pasta into colander in bowl, while reserving pasta water in bowl. 
                    Measure out 1 cup hot pasta water and discard remaining water. Immediately place pasta in now empty large bowl. </li>
                <li>Slowly pour and whisk 1/2 cup pasta water into egg mixture, then slowly pour mixture over pasta while tossing to coat. 
                    Add bacon and toss to combine. Season with salt if desired. </li> 
                <li>Let pasta rest, tossing frequently, 2 - 4 minutes until sauce has thickened slightly and coats pasta. 
                    Thin with remaining 1/2 cup hot pasta water as needed. Serve immediately topped with additional parmesan and parsley.</li>
